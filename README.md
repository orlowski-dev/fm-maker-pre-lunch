### What I learned
 I found out I can use more than one image as background image, and specify size and position for each of them 

```css
background-image: 
  url('./assets/illustration-hero-left.svg'),
  url('./assets/bg-hero-squiggle.svg'),
  url('./assets/illustration-hero-right.svg');

background-size:
  314px 356px,
  386px 268px,
  317px 365px;

background-position:
  left calc(50% - 400px) top,
  center,
  right calc(50% - 400px) top;
```
